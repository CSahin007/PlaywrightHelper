Hey Brian so this is basically the template I use to teach and reference back to if forget anything that ive learn about playwright.
Alot of test cases are meant to fail on purpose, the urls are left generic with generic locators, so i can reuse the framework in other projects if need
Just a basic overview of a simple framework of playwrights core benefits and methods.
Let me know if you have any questions!
